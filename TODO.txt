- post-install script for systmctl?
 
eg. (https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Absherman%2Fublue-custom%20dconf&type=code)

```
systemctl disable docker.socket
systemctl unmask dconf-update.service
systemctl enable dconf-update.service
systemctl enable rpm-ostree-countme.timer
systemctl enable tailscaled.service
```

- workflow trigger only on diff? 

i.e. separate workflow files, or matrix conditional idea like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65384420/how-do-i-make-a-github-action-matrix-element-conditional
